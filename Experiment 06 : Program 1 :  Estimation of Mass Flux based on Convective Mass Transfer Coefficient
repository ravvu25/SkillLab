# Define the variables
C1 = 0.1 # Concentration of pollutant in gas (mol/m^3)
C2 = 0.0 # Concentration of pollutant in water (mol/m^3, negligible)
k = 0.05 # Mass transfer coefficient (m/s)
# Calculate mass flux using the formula J = k * (C1 - C2)
mass_flux = k * (C1 - C2)
# Output the result
print(f"The mass flux of the pollutant from the gas to the water surface is {mass_flux:.3f} mol/m2Â·s")
